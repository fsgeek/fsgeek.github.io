So I&#8217;ve now been offered admission to two of the three PhD programs to which I have applied.  The third I knew was unlikely as they require a thesis Master&#8217;s degree, but I don&#8217;t have a thesis.  I was hoping that the fact I&#8217;ve co-authored two books might count for something (because frankly, writing a book is far more work than writing a thesis).

So for now I&#8217;m mulling over the best decision to make &#8211; but what an _amazing_ place to be: choosing between two excellent schools, with the choice of two amazing advisers.  There really isn&#8217;t a losing option at this point, which is an **amazing** place to be.
