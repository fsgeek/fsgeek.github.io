There have been a number of articles about the [AI TA for a class at Georgia Tech](https://backchannel.com/a-secret-ops-ai-aims-to-save-education-c1c887a56a67#.9gmxlajla).  I find these fascinating because I _took_ this class in the summer 2016 session.

I&#8217;ve considered ways to use this approach to facilitate online learning in other environments as well and I&#8217;d like to look into it more in the future. Nothing definite now, but I&#8217;ve had a few preliminary discussions. Let&#8217;s hope they bear fruit.

Stay tuned!
