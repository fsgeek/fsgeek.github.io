This is my new blog, dedicated to the world of file systems.

I&#8217;ve been working with file systems for some time now (longer than I&#8217;d care to admit).  If you are not familiar with a file system think of it as the software inside your computer that stores your data away and gets it back for you when you want it.  It provides the _organization_ to your storage device &#8211; whether it is a disk drive on your local computer or storage in some far-away location (&#8220;the cloud&#8221;).

It plugs into the critical software that runs your computer system and provides services to that applications can find your data as well.  When it works right, you hardly notice it &#8211; much like plumbing.  When it doesn&#8217;t work right, you suffer.

I&#8217;m not sure where this blog will take me, but I&#8217;m going to use it as a mechanism for tracking my own journey, organizing my own research.  If you find it interesting as well, that&#8217;s awesome!  If you don&#8217;t, it won&#8217;t diminish my own purpose for doing this.
