The decision deadline was last weekend and I confirmed my decision, accepting one of the offers and declining the other.  I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;ll be starting my new program officially near the end of summer.

I&#8217;m already starting to think about the fact that this journey is really about to begin.  I&#8217;d be lying if I said that I weren&#8217;t still in a bit of shock &#8211; euophoric shock, for sure, but still shock.  Despite everything that I had going against me, I managed to make this happen &#8211; and no amount of actually thinking about it makes me view it as quite a (wonderful) surprise.

For example, if I hadn&#8217;t been in the position to take the research assistant position with UBC, I suspect I&#8217;d have been less likely to have been offered admission there.  Of course, had I not been summarily dismissed from my job just a couple weeks earlier, i wouldn&#8217;t have been in a position to do so.   Pretty exciting, indeed!
