I&#8217;m on my way to the the [Symposium on Operating Systems Principles](https://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp17/), which is a well-known operating systems conference.  This time it is in Shanghai, China so I&#8217;m making my way there.  I do not have the privilege of presenting anything there this trip, but hopefully I will be able to do so in the future &#8211; it really is just a small matter of coming up with some interesting research that is worthy.

This will be my first time in China.  Definitely looking forward to seeing some of the interesting talks that are scheduled throughout the conference!
