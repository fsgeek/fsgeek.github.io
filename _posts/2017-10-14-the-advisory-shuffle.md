Friday, October 13, was my adviser&#8217;s last day.  He remains as an adjunct professor, but as such he cannot directly advise or supervise graduate students.  Thus, just a few weeks into my official life as a PhD student I find myself adrift.  While I _started_ adrift, over the past 10 months I stopped drifting and began focusing in a specific direction.  It is a peculiar thing &#8211; to be adrift, then to find direction and focus, and then be adrift again.  Humbling, certainly.  When adrift the first time around I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, or how good it is to work with someone that encourages crazy ideas.  I touched on this in my [last post. ](https://fsgeek.ca/2017/10/02/so-why-are-you-doing-this/)But life doesn&#8217;t always go the way we anticipate.

I spent a bit of time going through an existential crisis of sorts because **being adrift** meant that I had to once again consider all the various directions I might go. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing.  Considering externalities (they&#8217;re trying to recruit someone that would be an awesome match from a research perspective).  Considering crazy options (applying to go somewhere else).  Of course, there&#8217;s also the option of considering other faculty to serve as adviser, but that is surprisingly challenging.  One of the best fits isn&#8217;t in the same department, which creates other potential complications.  Sorting it all out takes time.

Then I realized that this is part of the challenge of completing a PhD &#8211; the willingness to persevere in the face of factors beyond my control.  Hence why I found myself asking why I wanted to do this.  I&#8217;m not a brilliant researcher though I like to think I&#8217;m at least a competent one.  I can write reasonably well.  My hope is that the insights I do have can be used to contribute something.  I&#8217;m also pragmatic enough to know that it is rather unlikely I will change the world.  Still, I&#8217;m idealistic enough to want to _try_ to change the world.

The good news is that none of this is an emergency.  I have time to look at options, to consider what I wish to achieve.  In the end, it will force me to look for clarity.  My hope is that I will actually find it.  Only time will tell.
