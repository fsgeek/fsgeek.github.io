<p><strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong></p>

<p>I am the sole owner of the information collected on this site. I only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give me via email or other direct contact from you. I will not sell or rent this information to anyone.</p>

<p>I will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted me. I will not share your information with any third party outside of my organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.</p>

<p>Unless you ask me not to, I may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Your Access to and Control Over Information</strong></p>

<p>You may opt out of any future contacts from me at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting me via the email address given on my website:</p>

<p>• See what data I have about you, if any.</p>

<p>• Change/correct any data I have about you.</p>

<p>• Have us delete any data I have about you.</p>

<p>• Express any concern you have about my use of your data.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>I take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>

<p>Wherever I collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to me in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>

<p>While I use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, I also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which I store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>

<p>My Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.</p>

<p><strong>If you feel that I am not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact me immediately via email or this website.</strong></p>
