## Summary

Seeking to build upon my extensive experience doing operating systems research and development. I seek to expand upon our knowledge of systems by identifying and demonstrating innovative improvements in the field.

## Work Experience

**[University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), [NSS Lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss/)**, January 2017 to August 2017

  * Research Assistant.  Working with Professor [Andrew Warfield](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/andrew-warfield) on research in operating systems research, with a focus on file systems related areas.

**[OSR Open Systems Resources, Inc](http://www.osr.com).** November 1994 to November 2016

  * Consulting Partner. In this role I was responsible for providing services to commercial customers, by designing and implementing key file systems technologies for file systems and file system filter drivers.  I was involved in critical aspects of our educational offerings, teaching classes in Driver Development, File Systems Development, File System mini-filter development and Kernel Debugging.  Focus was on the Windows OS platform.  Recent projects include: Isolation Filter Kit that provides multiple simultaneous views of a single file on either local or network storage without modifying the underlying file system.  This abstraction was useful for transparent per-file encryption in that different applications could be given different views (raw or encrypted) of the file, with coherency, specialized file system mini-filter for transparently backing up SQL databases to Azure, another for doing block level change tracking for SQL databases.

[**FORE Systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORE_Systems), September 1993 to November 1994

  * Technical Manager. In this role I was responsible commercial ATM adapter device driver development for PC platforms (Windows, Novell, and OS/2). Actively participated in the ATM Forum (SA&A  and LAN Emulation SWG).  Worked with both Microsoft and Novell to define and establish architectural support for ATM.

[**Transarc Corporation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transarc), July 1989 to September 1993

  * Area Manager. Technical management for DCE LFS physical media file systems work: coordinate activities of team members, managed DCE/DFS integration including working with key external partners: OSF, HP, IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation.
  * Member of Technical Staff. Transarc AFS development on various UNIX platforms, DCE/DFS development.  As a member of the Episode team I was responsible for designing and implementing the transactional system, still novel for its use of undo/redo model journaling.   Part of the DCE/DFS development team, participated in architecuture and design.

[**Stanford University**](http://www.cs.stanford.edu/), June 1987 to June 1989

  * Research Staff. Working in Professor [David Cheriton’s](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-cheriton) [Distributed Systems Group](http://gregorio.stanford.edu/).  Responsible for systems administration for the group.  Implemented the UNIX version of VMTP (_Versatile Message Transport Protocol_), a reliable transport protocol for use over IP, including IP multicast.  Wrote kernel mode device drivers for Ethernet NICs for the V Operating System, as well as a primitive kernel debugger.

## Education

  * University of British Columbia, Vancouver BC, January 2017 to Present 
      * PhD Computer Science, [Network, Systems & Security Lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss/), September 2017 to Present
  * [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta GA January 2015 to Present 
      * [OMSCS Program](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/), anticipated MSCS December 2017
  * [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), Chicago, IL September 1983 to June 1987 
      * SB Mathematics (Computer Science Concentration)

## Teaching Experience

  * Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta GA, August 2015 to Present. Teaching Assistant for Professor Ada Gavrilovska’s _Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems_.  Answer student questions (Piazza, Slack), assist in development and maintenance of automated grading system for student code, maintain documentation for student projects, enhance and document class procedures, coordinate activities with other TAs.
  * OSR Open Systems Resources Inc., Amherst, NH March 1996 to November 2016. Design and develop kernel mode development classes on Device Drivers, File System Drivers, File System Mini-Filter Drivers, Windows OS Internals, and Kernel Debugging for both lecture and lab workshop style classes.
