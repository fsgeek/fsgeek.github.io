<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Seeking to build upon my extensive experience doing operating systems research and development. I seek to expand upon our knowledge of systems by identifying and demonstrating innovative improvements in the field.</p>

<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss/">NSS Lab</a></strong>, January 2017 to August 2017</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research Assistant.  Working with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/andrew-warfield">Andrew Warfield</a> on research in operating systems research, with a focus on file systems related areas.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Consulting Partner. In this role I was responsible for providing services to commercial customers, by designing and implementing key file systems technologies for file systems and file system filter drivers.  I was involved in critical aspects of our educational offerings, teaching classes in Driver Development, File Systems Development, File System mini-filter development and Kernel Debugging.  Focus was on the Windows OS platform.  Recent projects include: Isolation Filter Kit that provides multiple simultaneous views of a single file on either local or network storage without modifying the underlying file system.  This abstraction was useful for transparent per-file encryption in that different applications could be given different views (raw or encrypted) of the file, with coherency, specialized file system mini-filter for transparently backing up SQL databases to Azure, another for doing block level change tracking for SQL databases.</li>
</ul>
