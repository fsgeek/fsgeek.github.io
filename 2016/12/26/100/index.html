<p>There have been a number of articles about the <a href="https://backchannel.com/a-secret-ops-ai-aims-to-save-education-c1c887a56a67#.9gmxlajla">AI TA for a class at Georgia Tech</a>.  I find these fascinating because I <em>took</em> this class in the summer 2016 session.</p>

<p>I’ve considered ways to use this approach to facilitate online learning in other environments as well and I’d like to look into it more in the future. Nothing definite now, but I’ve had a few preliminary discussions. Let’s hope they bear fruit.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
