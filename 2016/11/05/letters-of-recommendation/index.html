<p>Once again, I find myself in the position of asking people to write letters of recommendation.  My usual MO for this is to first ask if they are willing to do so. I make it clear that I will provide them with a template letter which they can then modify as they see fit – after all it is <strong>their</strong> letter, but it is to my benefit.  Thus, I want to minimize the hassle for them and ensure that the letter is strong.</p>

  <p>In that context, I ran across this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-normal-for-professors-to-refuse-to-write-a-recommendation-letter-until-that-student-gets-an-A">awesome post on Quora by Dr. Richard Muller</a> about what he asks students to write up to assist him.  The gist of this was his requirement that someone give him an <em>interview</em>:</p>

  <p class="qtext_para">
  My first step is to interview the student.  I ask to be reminded of every time in the past we had interacted, if at all. Normally I mention these times in my letter; it helped the reader to recognize that the student was active.
</p>

  <p class="qtext_para">
  Then I ask for any things that the student worried about, bad grades in other courses, for example. We then discussed them, and in my letter I might mention the fact that I was familiar with it (with a D, for example, in another class) and I would describe why (if true) I didn&#8217;t think that should be used as a negative. (Typically the student had a good reason.)
</p>

  <p class="qtext_para">
  I ask the student to write me a page describing what he thinks of himself/herself, and what the student does outside of classwork. That&#8217;s based on my experience that those reading my letter often like candidates more if the student was well-rounded and personable.

  I thought this was brilliant and plan on using this moving forward.
