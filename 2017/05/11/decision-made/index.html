<p>The decision deadline was last weekend and I confirmed my decision, accepting one of the offers and declining the other.  I’m excited that I’ll be starting my new program officially near the end of summer.</p>

<p>I’m already starting to think about the fact that this journey is really about to begin.  I’d be lying if I said that I weren’t still in a bit of shock – euophoric shock, for sure, but still shock.  Despite everything that I had going against me, I managed to make this happen – and no amount of actually thinking about it makes me view it as quite a (wonderful) surprise.</p>

<p>For example, if I hadn’t been in the position to take the research assistant position with UBC, I suspect I’d have been less likely to have been offered admission there.  Of course, had I not been summarily dismissed from my job just a couple weeks earlier, i wouldn’t have been in a position to do so.   Pretty exciting, indeed!</p>
