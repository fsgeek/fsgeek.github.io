<p>I’m on my way to the the <a href="https://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp17/">Symposium on Operating Systems Principles</a>, which is a well-known operating systems conference.  This time it is in Shanghai, China so I’m making my way there.  I do not have the privilege of presenting anything there this trip, but hopefully I will be able to do so in the future – it really is just a small matter of coming up with some interesting research that is worthy.</p>

<p>This will be my first time in China.  Definitely looking forward to seeing some of the interesting talks that are scheduled throughout the conference!</p>
