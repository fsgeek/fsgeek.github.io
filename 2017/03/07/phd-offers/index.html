<p>So I’ve now been offered admission to two of the three PhD programs to which I have applied.  The third I knew was unlikely as they require a thesis Master’s degree, but I don’t have a thesis.  I was hoping that the fact I’ve co-authored two books might count for something (because frankly, writing a book is far more work than writing a thesis).</p>

<p>So for now I’m mulling over the best decision to make – but what an <em>amazing</em> place to be: choosing between two excellent schools, with the choice of two amazing advisers.  There really isn’t a losing option at this point, which is an <strong>amazing</strong> place to be.</p>
